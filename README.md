# Learning Web Development 

I am trying to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript in a week. Follow my progress! 

### Some resources I am using:
Jon Duckett's *HTML & CSS* and *Javascript & JQuery*
Treehouse Front End Web Dev track 
General Assembly's WDI gitbook and assignments
Code Fellows Code 201 repository  
Other misc websites (learnlayout.com, MDN, the mighty google search, the beautiful stackoverflow)
